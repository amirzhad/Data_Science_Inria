# Data science technical-test for INRIA

## Repository content

* `ds_inria.ipynb`
* Data: 1 file in sql (2 tables exist: the patient table and the pcr table)


## Test guidelines

In this test, we have two tables: the patient information (ID, name, family, address, etc.) and the pcr test (ID and pcr). The pcr table indicates if an ID is COVID positive or negative.
The task is to find the dublicates considering that there might be typos in the data.
There is no constraint in python libraries
